                    require on the right-hand side. Specific flower bed cleaning, mulching, composting, and planting can be done as individual 
                    labors. Planting, mulching, and compost prices assume that you are providing the plants, mulch, or items 
                    to be composted. Additional fees will apply if we supply the aforementioned assumed items. We can also 
                    negotiate deals with our vendors for bulk orders or attach smaller orders for no additional cost.
